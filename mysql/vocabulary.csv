2,superkingdom,6e292b59478b02ac084e14437c892f03,"Category Term","2023-05-29 19:42:55","The kingdom was the highest taxonomic rank, before the introduction of the domain. In the past times, the different kingdoms were Animalia, Plantae, Fungi, Protista, Archaea, and Bacteria. But some of these classified groups were not accurate such as Protista. The protist includes all eukaryotic individuals who are not animals, plants, or fungi, but some of the individuals not closely related to each other. There is no agreement of this kingdom classification and some researchers abandoned it together. But in 2015, the researchers conclude the division of Protista in two new kingdoms; Protozoa and Chromista."
3,phylum,dcb3a2ca6e855c3131d99e124833087d,"Category Term","2023-05-29 19:42:55","After the kingdom, the phylum is the next rank. Its rank is more specific than the kingdom but is less specific than class rank. There are 35 Phyla lies in the kingdom Animalia, such as including Chordata (an individual having a dorsal nerve cord), Porifera (sponges), and Arthropoda (arthropods)."
4,class,a2f2ed4f8ebc2cbb4c21a29dc40ab61d,"Category Term","2023-05-29 19:42:55","Before the phyla studies, Linnaeus proposed the most general rank of class. There are 108 different classesï¿½ lies in Animalia; including the Mammalia, Aves (birds), and Reptilia, among many others. The class of Animalia which is used today is similar to the Animalia which was purposed by Linnaeus. But the plant class which was purposed by Linnaeus was based on attributes such as the arrangement of flowers is different than todayï¿½s class which is not based on botany."
5,order,70a17ffa722a3985b86d30b034ad06d7,"Category Term","2023-05-29 19:42:55","The rank order is more specific than the class. Some orders of Linnaeus till used nowadays including Lepidoptera (order of moths and butterflies). There are often between 19-26 orders of Mammalia which depends on how organisms are classified as source different. Some of the orders of Mammalia are Primates, Cetaceans, Carnivora, and Chiroptera."
6,family,0d3fda0bdbb9d619e09cdf3eecba7999,"Category Term","2023-05-29 19:42:55","The rank of Family is much specific. There is a total of 12 families lie in order Carnivora. Some families in Carnivora are Canidae, Felidae, Mephitidae, and Ursidae."
7,genus,030e7a0c88678ad58332b67fe03a78e6,"Category Term","2023-05-29 19:42:55","The rank Genus is more specific than rank of family. The Binomial Nomenclature is an organismï¿½s scientific name that has the first part genus and the second part is species. The Genus and Species are the italicized taxonomic ranks. The scientific name used for humans is Homo Sapiens. Homo is the name of the genus, while Sapiens is the species name. Some of them were ancestral to humans, like Homo Erectus. Other livings at the same time were much closely related. It interbred with Homo Sapiens as Homo Neanderthalensis, the Neanderthals."
8,species,cd3d20b9461987685a810f405a9fcfb2,"Category Term","2023-05-29 19:42:55","The rank species is the much scientific taxonomic rank. Sometimes, species are divided into the subspecies, while all species do not have multiple forms that are different even known as subspecies. There are approximate 8.7 million different species of organisms present on the earth as many organisms not yet discovered and categorized. In fact, the name of each genus is unique, while the same species names can be used in terms of different organisms. The name of species is always italicized but never be capitalized. It is the only rank that is not capitalized."
9,"scientific name",0d53e150835643542ac7d41bb0c89677,"Category Term","2023-05-29 19:42:55","Scientific names are formal Latin names that are used to classify all organisms, both living and extinct. This formal name differs from the everyday names we use because it provides information about the organismâ€™s genus and species. By writing and using a scientific name properly, you can communicate clearly about a specific organism."
